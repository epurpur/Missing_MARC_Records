\f0\fs24 \cf0 MARC Records\
\
A MARC record is a Machine Readable Cataloging Record. It is a bibliographic cataloging record which is traditionally the information shown on a catalog card. The record includes a description of the item, main entry and added entries, subject headings, the classification or call number.\
\
	1. Description. Librarians follow the Anglo-american Cataloging rules (AACR2) to compose the bibliographic description of a library item. This includes the title, statement of responsibility, edition, material specific detains, publication info, etc\'85\
	2. Main entry and added entries: AACR2 also contains rules for determining access points to the record and the form these access points should take. Access points are the retrieval points in the library catalog where patrons should be able to look up the item.\
	3. Subject Headings: The librarian uses Library of Congress Subject Headings to select the subjects under which the item will be listed. Use of an approved list is important for consistency to ensure that all items on a particular subject are found under the same heading and the same place in the catalog. \
	4. Call Number: The Library of Congress Classification schedule is used to select the call number for an item. The purpose of the call number is to place items on the same subject together on the same shelf in the library. \
\
\
RDA was adopted by library of congress in 2013 as their official descriptive cataloging standard. Bibliographic records are created in the MARC format for RDA the same as for AACR2. Both AACR2 and RDA MARC records will coexist in the library database.\
\
\
Why is a MARC record necessary?\
The information from a catalog card cannot simply be typed into a computer to produce an automated catalog. The computer needs a means of interpreting the information found on a cataloging record. The MARC record contains a guide to its data, or little \'93signposts\'94 before each piece of bibliographic information. The place provided for each of these pieces of bibliographic information is called a \'93field\'94. The records in simpler computer files sometimes have a fixed number of fields, and each field contains a fixed number of characters. To allow proper cataloging of books and other library items, the best file structure allows for records with an unlimited number of fields and unlimited field lengths. The flexibility is necessary because not all titles are the same lengths. \
\
\
Summary\'85\
\
MARC records are standardized data formats used by libraries to store and exchange bibliographic information. They contain structured fields and subfields that describe various aspects of library materials such as title, author, publication information, subject headings. These records enable libraries to organize and retrieve information about their collections efficiently, facilitating resource sharing and cataloging processes. \
